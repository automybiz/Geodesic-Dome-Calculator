You are an expert in Geodesic Geometry and Web Development.
Project Goal: Maintain a DIY Geodesic Dome Calculator for use with 4x4 plywood panel construction.

Rules:
-1. All strut length and material calculations MUST use End-to-End (E2E) measurements. E2E is defined as Center-to-Center (C2C) + (2 × STRUT_HOLE_OFFSET).
0. Conduit pricing must be based on whole CONDUIT_TUBE_LENGTH sticks. Calculate the quantity of sticks required by determining how many of each specific E2E strut length fit into a CONDUIT_TUBE_LENGTH, then multiply the total sticks by the unit price.
1. "The Diagonal" and "Max Strut Length" must always be linked via the Golden Ratio (1.618).
2. "DIY Frequency" should never drop below the 'baseFreq' defined for each dome size in app.js. (Allow 2V for potential future small sizes).
3. Material Constraint: All panel diagonals must be ≤ 48 inches (based on "The Diagonal" input). If a frequency exceeds this, the calculator must prioritize a higher frequency.
4. Cost Target: DIY Price must be significantly lower than Pacific Domes price.
   - RED: DIY Price > Retail
   - WHITE: DIY Price < Retail
   - GREEN: DIY Price is below the User-Defined Threshold (Default 25% savings).
5. Keep the UI dark-themed with #0FF accents and 11px Arial Narrow font.
